We're thrilled to announce the start of the development of **BGStracker**.

Currently, we have the following first steps:

1. Define the communication scheme between the EDMC plugin and the webapp.
2. Work on the EDMC plugin.
3. Work on system influence management features.

Then we'll release the very first version of the webapp.

The rest still need to be defined.
